# Layer Quick Start for iOS - Swift Version

This is a version of the Layer [quick-start-ios](https://github.com/layerhq/quick-start-ios) project that I rewrote in Swift in order to learn more about how to use Layer. The code was mostly rewritten line by line, after which I made a few minor refactoring changes, so it should function in rougly the same way as the original [quick-start-ios](https://github.com/layerhq/quick-start-ios) project.

See the original Layer  [quick-start-ios README.md](https://github.com/layerhq/quick-start-ios/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
